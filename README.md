# Green toys webshop

This site is the Milestone Project 4 for the Software Development Diploma course at Code Institute. The project is aimed at displaying my 
understanding of full stack development with Django framework and building upon all previous learning in the course to put together a fully functional
website.

The purpose of this site is to provide means for parents and others to buy eco-friendly toys for their children. The reasoning behind this is that children (at least in societal
contexts where economical conditions are strong) often have an abundance of toys, and these are more often than not made of different sort of plastics. As the manufacturing of plastics 
results in negative effects on the environment, many people find it important to try to avoid contributing to this by limiting or avoiding their use of plastic materials. When it comes
to toys, avoiding plastics can be percieved as important both for the sake of minimizing negative effects on the environment and because plastic toys can contain potentially harmful
substances. Because of this, many people find it especially important that the things that children use are made of environment-friendly materials that are free from harmful substances,
and there is therefore a need for providing such things as toys that are guaranteed to be tested for substances that can be harmful to children and that are made out of material that 
cause as little harm as possible to the environment. This website is aimed at providing an easy way for parents and others interested to purchase these kind of eco-friendly toys.
